## Introduction
This project aims to create a simple implementation of the MapReduce concept in Java.
This will allow to visualize and empirically demonstrate Ahmdal's law.
I will use a word count process for this implementation, and I will compare the results between this distributed implementation and a sequential one.

This project is based upon a [practical work](https://remisharrock.fr/courses/simple-hadoop-mapreduce-from-scratch/) in Télécom Paris (SLR207 course), taught by Rémi Sharrock.
